Code Generation

Use prompt-driven scaffolding for components, routes, and Prisma schemas

Example: “Generate a task model with priority, status, and strategic tags”

Testing

Auto-generate unit and integration tests using AI agents

Example: “Write Jest tests for task creation and status updates”

Documentation

Maintain docstrings and inline comments via AI suggestions

Use AI to summarize commits and generate release notes

Example: “Summarize this diff and update README with new feature”

Context-Aware Techniques

Feed API specs, file trees, and diffs into AI workflows for smarter prompts

Example: “Given this file tree, suggest missing test coverage”
